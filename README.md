# LesS/KEY

This is a project to build a password management tool based on the
S/Key system described in the
[RFC2289](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2289). This password manager
is made with following goals in mind:

1. Passwords need to be memorable, secure and easy to type on any
   keyboard.
   
   The passwords which are generated with LesS/KEY can be easy
   momoized and used without the generator. Generate the passwords
   only if you forgot a password, it reduces the number of times you
   enter your master password dramatically.

1. It should work every where.

   In fact you even do not require this particular tool, but can use
   any tool which is capable of generating S/Key SHA-1 passwords. So
   you have the garantee, that you can generate the password also
   without access to this particular tool. For most UNIX systems you
   can install the `skey` or equivalent command, which also generate
   exactly the same passwords.
   
1. You should be able to use it in a safe way even if the whole time
   you generate a password some body look on your screen.
   
   With LesS/KEY you can generate your passwords securely, also if
   some body look on your screen and you are on a foreign PC. (do not
   generate passwords on devices that you do not trust!)
   
1. It should work offline and should never send anything through
   network.
   
   Files from this repository and a browser are enought to use this
   tool, you do not need to install something. It is also usable on
   any smart phone or similar devices, also without permanent
   connection to the internet.
   
1. It should not store anything anywhere and should be also usable on
   foreign systems.

# General use case

This is password manager and a password generator, you need a main
password (`secret`) and you can generate a password based on a
name (`id`). Typical usage:

1. Enter a name to the `id` field, f.e. if you need a password for
   Amazon, than enter `amazon` here. It is also possible to enter
   `amazonXX` with any number of `X` after the name, in this case the
   system will replace all `X` characters with a random number with
   maximum number of digits equals to number of `X` entered. This is
   usefull if you think to change the password on a regular basis,
   simply enter again `XX` and it will generate a new number and a new
   password.
   
1. If the system you need a password for require a password with
   special characters, than enter a string wich required special
   characters in `type` (`prefix`) field. You can use the same prefix
   string in all passwords, usualy something like `#A0`. This field do
   not really add any security, it is only to give dump systems the
   character classes they want.
   
   In case, where the system you need the password for do not accept
   our default password representation, you can generate a different
   one changing the `type` field. Following representations are
   available now:
   
   1. `reg (regular)`: usual 6 words S/Key representation.

      If possible, please use this representation, because it is easy
      to type, to remember and have no problems with special
      characters.
  
   1. `nsp (no spaces)`: usual 6 words S/Key representation with `-`
      (minus) character instead of space
      
      This representation should be used, if no space is allowed in
      the target system.
      
   1. `hex (hexadecimal)`: hex representation of the password
   
      Use this representation, if you have length or other strange
      constraints on allowed password.
   
   1. `b64 (base64)`: base64 representation without `=` character for
      padding
   
      Most systems with the (officially deprecated and dangerous)
      constraints on character classes in password will accept this
      representation. If not enough character classes are present, use
      the `prefix` or simply try to change the `id` (`key name`) and
      generate again.
   
   1. `dec (decimal)`: decimal representation
   
      Some systems allow only numbers, like a PIN for tablet, an App
      or similar. Please use so many numbers from this representation
      you are able to enter in the target system.
      
1. Enter your master password in the field `secret`. If you click on
   the label `secret` then the system make the password visible,
   usually to verify that you entered the password correctly. If you
   do not want make the password visible, but you are not sure if it
   is entered correctly, than you can enter the password in the
   `verify` field a second time. In this case LesS/KEY will check if
   the passwords are equal and show an error if not.

1. Click on button `generate` (or simply press `enter` key) to
   generate the password and the password will be entered in the
   field with the name `key`.
   
1. Click on the choosen represtation and on the button `copy
   selected`, if this button do not work on your browser, than simple
   select the full text in the field (f.e. through tripple click with
   the mouse or regular text selection). The password is not visible
   but it is perfectly selectable, so you do not need to click on
   `show` button to copy/paste the password.

This password manager do not store any names or passwords and do not
communicate with anything, all calculations are done within your
browser. Common way is to write down the meta information about each
generated password in a system, which you can access as easy as
possible. Personally I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) for it,
because I can access it through browser, on any smart phone through
the app and also on the UNIX shell with the Evernote API. I store
following information there:

- URL of the web page or something else to identify the system
- Exact `id` I have used (e.g. with generated number)
- Prefix used (I use the same prefix every where and notice only if I
  have used prefix or not, but not the prefix itself)
- Representation I have used (type, number of digits for decimal)
- Date on which the password was generated or changed
- Login name, birthday entered and similar meta data to be able to
  login or recover password later

The `id` has no security value, so you do not need to encrypt this
information, only your secret should really be secret.

Usually you do not need to change the first part of `id` field
(usually `99`), it is only needed if you use this password manager as
a S/Key calculator, playing with thin number without knowing what you
are doing is dangerous.

# S/Key usage

This password manager can also be used as a S/Key calculator, if you
login to a system with enabled S/Key athentication method, then type
the sequence number, seed and secret, click on `generate` and
copy/paste your password. Usually it looks like follows:

```
$> ssh karam@outer.space.unknown
Password [ otp-sha1 45 oute52436 ]:
```

In this example 45 is the first `id` part and `oute52436` is the
second.

Warning: only SHA-1 S/Key mode is supported and S/Key is not safe to
use, if any one could see your password. Do not use it through
unencrypted connections! (I know, S/Key was developed initally for
this case, but trust me, you should not use unencrypted connections)

This is usefull, if your need f.e. login to your server from a PC,
which you do not trust (internet caffee f.e.). You could use LesS/KEY
on your smartphone to generate the one time password and type it on
this PC. Even if some body logs the keyboard, this password is usable
only one single time and you have already used it, so it is useless to
an later attacker.

# Hierarchical passwords

It is possible to use multiple master passwords in a hierarhical way:

1. Type a `id` name for the master password

1. Type your mastermaster password in `secret` field

1. Click on `generate` and on `switch`

1. Type the name of page you need the password for in `id`

1. Click on `generate` and use it as usual

The reason to use hierarchical passwords is to use own master
passwords for different types of systems. Typically you memoize the
generated master passwords and use it, instead of using the
mastermaster password. In this way, if you loose the master password
you need only reset the passwords on a bunch of services intstead of
all services you have ever generated passwords for.

For example I use one master password for home, one for work and one
for regular web pages. All of the master passwords are generatable,
but I memoize them and do typically never type the mastermaster
password somewhere. I do also memoize the generated passwords for all
important systems, but if I forget one (f.e. after a vacation) I can
generate it again any time.

# Security considerations

This password manager was inspired by the XKCD commic:

[![password_strength](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)](https://www.xkcd.com/936/)

Internally it generates SHA-1 checksum chained `seq #` number of
times from `seed` and `secret` concatenated together. The result is
reduced to a 64 bit number and represented as 6 words, with the scheme
from [RFC2289](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2289). Other
representations are simply different representations of this 64 bits.

The [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) is considered as
insecure, because it is possible to generate multiple documents with
same checksum. This weakness do not apply here, because the
possibility to genarate multiple seed/secret combinations which
creates same password is irrelevant for the use case here.

Also S/Key is considered as insecure, because it is unsafe to use it
on unencrypted links. Do not use unencrypted interfaces or systems,
where some body could read your password, S/Key, OTP or this password
manager will not help you in such cases.

Do not generate passwords on devices that you do not trust!
